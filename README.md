### How to create a Github Page  
1. Make a new public repository, named <username>github.io
2. Create, add, commit, and push a new "index.html" file onto the repository
3. A new Action should start in the Action tab that automatically builds and publishes the page
4. Wait for it to complete, and it should be live!
### My takeaways  
Publishing a website is much more accessible than it seems, and the idea of flexboxes aren't as complicated as I thought. I used flexboxes in CMSC 12 but it felt like I was doing trial and error, I'm glad that the concept has been expanded upon.  
I also was able to deepen my insight into the structure of HTML and CSS, especially in terms of spacing and utilizing white space.
